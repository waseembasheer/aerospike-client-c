 * @module aerospike/policy
 *
 * @description The policy module defines policies and policy values that
 * define the behavior of database operations.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * const Aerospike = require('aerospike')
 *
 * // global policy, applied to all commands that do not override it
 * let config = {
 *   policies: {
 *     socketTimeout: 50,
 *     totalTimeout: 100
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * let key = new Aerospike.Key('test', 'demo', 'k1')
 *
 * Aerospike.connect(config)
 *   .then(client => {
 *     let record = {i: 1234}
 *
 *     // override policy for put command
 *     let policy = new Aerospike.policy.WritePolicy({
 *       exists: Aerospike.policy.exists.CREATE,
 *       key: Aerospike.policy.key.SEND
 *     })
 *
 *     return client.put(key, record, {}, policy)
 *       .then(() => client.close())
 *       .catch(error => {
 *         client.close()
 *         if (error.code === Aerospike.status.ERR_RECORD_EXISTS) {
 *           console.info('record already exists')
 *         } else {
 *           return Promise.reject(error)
 *         }
 *       })
 *   })

 * Specifies the behavior for whether keys or digests should be sent to the

 * mode of operation. This calculates the digest and sends the digest to the
 * server. The digest is only calculated on the client, and not the server.
 *
 * @property SEND - Send the key, in addition to the digest value. If you want
 * keys to be returned when scanning or querying, the keys must be stored on
 * the server. This policy causes a write operation to store the key. Once the
 * key is stored, the server will keep it - there is no need to use this policy
 * on subsequent updates of the record. If this policy is used on read or
 * delete operations, or on subsequent updates of a record with a stored key,
 * the key sent will be compared with the key stored on the server. A mismatch
 * will cause <code>ERR_RECORD_KEY_MISMATCH</code> to be returned.
